Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Security Scanning automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Spring Boot application with integrated security checks. The pipeline features code checkout from GitHub, Maven build and testing, SonarQube analysis, OWASP Dependency Check for vulnerabilities, and Docker image building and scanning using Trivy. The final validated Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub. This project aims to ensure code quality and security throughout the CI/CD lifecycle.
